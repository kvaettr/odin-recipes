        <li>In a large mixing bowl beat butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add 1-1/2 cups sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt. Beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally. Beat in eggs and vanilla until combined. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer.
